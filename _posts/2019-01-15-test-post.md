  This is my first post in this website. I discovered Netlify services not so
  much time ago, but i hope to develop a better portal for my two websites:
  [www.kalwaltart.it](https://www.kalwaltart.it) and
  [www.walterperdan.com](https://www.walterperdan.com). 


  I use - the first - to show my interactive works and the second to present my
  artistic research in general. I am a visual artist that works in different
  fields: Painting, sculpture, drawing and in the past also performance. I have
  also a passion for computer science and programming languages, and this
  interest brought me to the interaction world. I hope that you will found
  something interesting in this website and the other, and you may appreciate
  it.


  This website is built as already said with [Netlify](https://netlify.com) very
  interresting service, if you need and if you have time take a look at.


  I have no idea of the future of this website if i have time i will post my
  result here.
